# Dropout_Indicator

Using the dataset provided by Marouan Daghmoumi, I created a XGBoost model that would determine wether a student would graduate or dropout depending on a certain amount of features. My model has an accuracy of almost 90% and a precision of 97% for dropouts because I wanted to have my model be useful to determine the types of students that would need more assistance since they would be at a greater chance of dropping out. Some key insights were then deduced at the bottom of the notebook.
